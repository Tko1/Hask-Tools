# hask-tools

This library is my attempt to play with and implement various Haskell features. The goal for now is to have monads, monad transformers,  adt, some form of static type checking,  some macros for writing code with haskell syntax , curried functions,  and lens / prisms.  I am late uploading this to github, and have not looked at it for a little while, and as such I do not have a tally of what I have implemented so far, but I believe most of the things listed have been implemented already in one form or another.

TODO:
1. Clean up code
2. List library goals
3. List what has already been done
4. Rewrite Readme to reflect all of the above.
5. Separate any code that should be a separate library.
6. Write usage for current tools, write tutorials for current tools.
