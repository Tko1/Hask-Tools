# hask-tools

## Description 
This library is a set of utilities inspired by various Haskell features. These utilities include:
##### hask-tools.monad
  
##### hask-tools.adt
An implementation of abstract data types.
##### hask-tools.functor
A protocol for the Functor interface
##### hask-tools.hsynt
Functions for writing code with a more Haskellian syntax / style (in progress).
##### hask-tools.lens
An implementation of lens, the "functional reference".
##### hask-tools.monoid
A protocol for the Monoid interface
##### hask-tools.typed
Originally meant as series of macros to created a statically typed Clojure,  this has been replaced by some utility functions in hask-tools.util that use clojure.spec to validate data.
