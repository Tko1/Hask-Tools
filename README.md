# hask-tools

Edit: This project is old,  and none of it is idiomatic -- this was my 'familiarizer' project for Clojure, the process I go through when familiarizing myself with a language (not necessarily the features, often more its libraries and maybe features I've missed) by churning out something like this, trying to just use as much of the core language as possible, after which I'll try to make a 'second pass' through the language, looking up idioms at every turn.  Try not to judge me ;) 
## Description 
This library is a set of utilities inspired by various Haskell features. These utilities include:
##### hask-tools.monad
  
##### hask-tools.adt
An implementation of algebraic data types.
##### hask-tools.functor
A protocol for the Functor interface
##### hask-tools.hsynt
Functions for writing code with a more Haskellian syntax / style (in progress).
##### hask-tools.lens
An implementation of lens, the "functional reference".
##### hask-tools.monoid
A protocol for the Monoid interface
##### hask-tools.typed
Originally meant as series of macros to created a statically typed Clojure,  this has been replaced by some utility functions in hask-tools.util that use clojure.spec to validate data.

##### hask-tools.monad.parser
A full on monadic parser suite.  However, derived half from scratch to build intuition, so may not be 1:1 with normal monadic parsers
